# OperatingPlatforms

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client that had developed a game that was only available in an Android app. They wanted us to design a web-based version of their game that could serve multiple platforms. They required that the software would allow one or more teams to be involved in each game and each team to have multiple players. They also required the software to ensure that each game, team name, and player name is unique and only one instance of a game, team, or player exists in memory at any given time. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I explained the domain model particularly well in this documentation. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through explaining the UML class diagram was helpful in creating a good foundation and plan for developing the code.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my evaluation and recommendations of operating platforms. This is because I’m not entirely confident in my knowledge of these concepts. I think if I were to gain more hands-on experience with all three operating platforms, I would be able to provide better explanations. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by reading how they wanted their game to perform, then planning how each of the goals could be carried out in the software. Creating a UML diagram helped to create a good design strategy to do this. It’s important to consider the user’s needs when designing, because it creates a better foundation for a developer to build upon. When you consider all the user’s needs, you can ensure that you are designing software that enhances the user experience. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
We first approached designing software by learning about how the game should operate and the client’s software requirements. This helped us to identify certain design constraints, and from there we could create a UML class diagram to plan the code even further. I would use these techniques of carefully reviewing software requirements and keeping the user experience in mind to analyze and design a similar software application.
